# aws-amplify-stepfunctions-example

> [!Note]
> This sample was originally published on the AWS Front-End Web & Mobile blog in the post [Integrate AWS Step Functions with AWS Amplify using Amplify custom resources](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/integrate-aws-step-functions-with-aws-amplify-using-amplify-custom-resources/). The original version used the AWS Amplify CLI to create the custom resource. The current version uses Amplify Gen 2 instead.

In this sample, we'll demonstrate how to integrate custom resources with AWS Amplify Gen 2 using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). We'll create a Step Functions workflow as an Amplify custom resource and connect it to an existing Amplify-managed GraphQL API.

## What you will learn

- How to create a Step Functions workflow as an Amplify custom resource using the AWS CDK.
- How to connect our custom resource to an existing Amplify-managed GraphQL API.

## What you will build

The proposed solution consists of the following elements:

- Our sample web application is a customer feedback form built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Amplify UI](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/).
- Submitting the feedback form will trigger a Step Functions [express workflow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-standard-vs-express.html) created as an Amplify custom resource via an [AWS AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/) API managed by Amplify.
- The Step Function workflow will detect the sentiment of the submitted feedback using [Amazon Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/)â€™s `DetectSentiment` API.
- Next, the workflow will store the feedback and detected sentiment in an Amplify-managed [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) table.
- If a non-positive sentiment is detected, the workflow will trigger a notification to a customer support email address using the [Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/).
- Depending on the result of the sentiment analysis, our web application will display different confirmation messages to the customer.

The Step Functions workflow looks like this:

From the perspective of the user of our web application, the result will look like this:

## Deploy the sample

To deploy the sample, you need to have Node.js 18.x or later installed on your machine.

Clone the repository and navigate to the `aws-amplify-stepfunctions-example` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-amplify-stepfunctions-example.git
cd aws-amplify-stepfunctions-example
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm ci
```

Fill in your email address in the `amplify/backent.ts` file to receive the notification emails:

```diff
new CustomResources(
    backend.createStack('customResources'),
    'customResources',
    {
        data: {
            apiId: backend.data.apiId,
        },
        notification: {
-             emailAddress: "hello@email.com" // Fill in your email address
        }
    }
);
```

Deploy the sample:

```bash
npx ampx sandbox
```

After the deployment is complete, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
